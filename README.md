## Quick Start

Run the following in your favorite terminal:

## Starting from Scratch

- Set up Yarn: <https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable>
- Install the Gatsby CLI globally:

```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

- Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:

gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/antoniojhun/Covid19Map
```

For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:

```
gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/antoniojhun/Covid19Map
```

- Navigate to your new directory and run:

```
yarn develop
```

- You should now be running a new Gatsby site locally! ðŸŽ‰
